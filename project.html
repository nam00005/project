              <p class="deck center">For a considerable number of years I had been a resident in London, which city I regarded alternately as my Paradise and my House of Bondage. I am by no means one of those who are always ready to fling opprobrious epithets at London, such as 'a pestilent wen,' a cluster of 'squalid villages,' and the like; on the contrary.</p>

But to really see them, to feel their softness and breathe in their scent, you must hike. Up. And up some more. The Western larch grow from 1,600 to 7,000 feet and the alpine larch can be found above 5,200 feet in the north Cascades and above 6,000 feet a bit to the south.</p>

                It was worth it, despite our overly ambitious journey that included a rainy drive from Seattle over Stevens Pass to the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest near Lake Chelan, a late start on the trail and unexpected snowfall. The larch tree is a deciduous conifer — it looks like an evergreen in the summer and it has cones, but its needles turn yellow and fall off in autumn.The Western larch grows on the east side of the Cascades from Oregon to southern British Columbia, Canada, as well as in the mountains of northeast Washington and Oregon, northern Idaho and western Montana.</p>
              
              <h2>Part 5 Green: Green Color and its Efffect</h2>
              <p>The Pacific Northwest, of course, is a wonder of color in the fall. But to include a larch hike adds another dimension. Tom Hinckley, professor emeritus at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences has this to say about the experience: “Regarding fall colors: Western larch is spectacular; however, subalpine is out of this world.</p>
