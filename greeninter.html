      <span class="first-letter">Y</span> ou can spot the gold of the larch trees high on the eastern and northern Cascades. But to really see them, to feel their softness and breathe in their scent, you must hike. Up. And up some more. The Western larch grow from 1,600 to 7,000 feet and the alpine larch can be found above 5,200 feet in the north Cascades and above 6,000 feet a bit to the south.

        It was worth it, despite our overly ambitious journey that included a rainy drive from Seattle over Stevens Pass to the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest near Lake Chelan, a late start on the trail and unexpected snowfall. The larch tree is a deciduous conifer — it looks like an evergreen in the summer and it has cones, but its needles turn yellow and fall off in autumn.The Western larch grows on the east side of the Cascades from Oregon to southern British Columbia, Canada, as well as in the mountains of northeast Washington and Oregon, northern Idaho and western Montana. The alpine larch grows at higher elevations in the northern Cascades and northern Rockies of North America. There are other varieties as well — for example, the Siberian larch in Russia and the tamarack or American larch in the northern Midwest and eastern U.S. and Canada.

      The Pacific Northwest, of course, is a wonder of color in the fall. But to include a larch hike adds another dimension. Tom Hinckley, professor emeritus at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences has this to say about the experience: “Regarding fall colors: Western larch is spectacular; however, subalpine is out of this world.”

     He said in an email that he also likes to view the larches in the spring, with the “soft green color of its foliage against the very dark green of the evergreen conifers.”

     He recommends several hikes off State Highway 20 (Heather-Maple Pass Loop, Cutthroat Pass and Kangaroo Pass) and in the Enchantments in the Alpine Lake Wilderness (Esmeralda Basin, Ingall’s Lake and Long’s Pass) to see the alpine larch. In the Enchantments, about 15 miles southwest of Leavenworth, you can see both varieties.

        Plus, plants don’t need much fertilizer, but you can give them light feedings during the spring and summer growing season. Be careful not to overfertilize— this can cause your succulent to grow too quickly and become weak.
